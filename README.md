# Arduino-Bluetooth-String
Reading and writing Strings using the Bluetooth modules on Arduino has been a challenging event. I have thoroughly searched the internet and have mixed a few things to create this basic working code for receival and transfering of Strings via Bluetooth on the Arduino platform.


I am attaching two applications developed in the MIT App Inventor AppyBuilder, it is a coding free cloud based app development platform.

You can try the two applications namely 

ARDUINOCONNECT : Here the user can give Voice input which will then be converted to text using the Google API furthermore, the data string will be sent over to the bluetooth device one is connected to. For further understanding, the smartphone behaves as a bluetooth client, the bluetooth module connected to the Arduino behaves as a Server. Notifications can be read on the screen on the provided area. THIS APP IS IDEAL FOR HOME AUTOMATION

LEAKSTA : This app is an inferior version to ArduinoConnect adn behaves as an output device for Arduinos. My team and I introduced a speech output to the Application so that one can simply get notifications out loud. It was used for a Water Leakage Detection Project which I will explain in the newer repositories.


METHOD TO USE THE APPS

1. Install the Applications on your Smartphones.
2. Open Device Settings, turn on Bluetooth.
3. Search for the desired Bluetooth Connection and pair up with the Arduino Bluetooth module.
4. Open the Application (ArduinoConnect/Leaksta)
5. CLick on the Bluetooth Button within the application.
6. Select the paired device to connect with.
7. VOila, the application is ready for use.

IMPORTANT NOTE : The apps have been developed for testing purposes, they are not monetized, please do not misuse the codes or the application. I am grateful to the contributors of the code, the App Inventor Community and the various coders besides my team.
